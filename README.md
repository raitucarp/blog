# Personal Web Log

This repository is my personal log that currently write in Bahasa Indonesia and few of English content. In the near future, I will add more English content. Which is my training program to write everything in The English language. Toward my goal and challenge to write 1000 words every day.

At the time, I will prove to myself about productivity myth (according to myself), that it's not a myth at all, rather than it's possible. This happens because right now I believe that I have ADHD and it hamper me to be a successful person.

This lazy habit should be ended as immediately as possible by myself.
